This project was guided by my CodeCademy Front-End Development course project titled "Appointment Planner". 

The App allows a user, on the "Contacts" page, to input a someone they know into their contacts list with respective name, phone, and email. The resulting list is rendered to the screen in tiles format. 

On the second page, "Appointments", the user is able to create appointments by inputting the title of an appointment, the date, and time, as well as selecting a contact from their contacts list (created on the "Contacts" page) from which the appointment should correspond to. The resulting list of appointments is rendered to the screen in tiles format. 

My goals before starting the project included:  

    - to orient myself with react router v6

    - create a functional app with multiple pages and states

    - understand useEffect and any other neccesary react hooks

    - reinforce file management principles (i.e. /src/components vs /src/pages

-------------------------------------------
Notes:

    -Difficulty level: medium-hard

    -instances of frustration/block: 0

    -time to complete: 6 hours

    -where I can improve: creating stateful vs stateless components, prop passing between components, advanced .map() jsx, testing React applications with Jest and Enzyme
